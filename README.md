# Theodore's Project of Video Games Reviews and Summary !

This is a basic HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ✨ immediately in the preview window. On the left you'll see the files that make up your site, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets`. The rest is up to you and your imagination. 🦄

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: The main page of my project

← `project.html`: v

← `contact.html`: contact information to find me

← `about.html` : what my project is about

← `style.css` : CSS stylesheet that customizes the HTML

## What have I've learned?

I have learned basic HTML and CSS. I learned how to use the terminal to connect to github.
